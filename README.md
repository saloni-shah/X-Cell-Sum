Basic app which display sum of entire column in the bottom row. It handles following things:
- Supports positive and negative integers.
- Ignores blank cells
- Ignores non-numeric cells. A sum should still be calculated if some cells are text (like “apple”) and other cells are numbers, in the  same column.
- Numbers can be anywhere in the column.
- Numbers do not have to start at the top of the column.
- Numbers do not have to be adjacent.

You can also add a row and column and highlight entire row or column.
Have fun playing with it!
